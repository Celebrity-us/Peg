<strong>
IMPORTANT UPDATE:


</strong>
<br>
<br>
 Regarding Mary Holmes's scheduled meeting with Steve Perry on August 30, 2025, in La Quinta Inn & Suites Panama City Beach, Florida. 

<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>
Please read the terms below carefully and take the necessary action
</strong>

<br>
<br><br>

 During the processing of your ticket, you were automatically upgraded to Exclusive Intimate Status. This status allows you direct access to a private intimate dinner with Steve Perry. To confirm this upgrade, you will receive an Exclusive Intimate Upgrade Certificate.
<br>
<br>

Before you proceed, it's important to understand the difference between the Ticket and the Exclusive Intimate Upgrade Certificate. The main difference is that the ticket grants you access to the event, while the Exclusive Intimate Upgrade Certificate grants you legal access to Steve Perry.

<br>
<br><br>

We understand this next part might be inconvenient for you: although you have already paid for the Ticket, a separate payment is required for the Exclusive Intimate Upgrade Certificate. However, there's good news! We recognize that this additional expense may be unexpected and inconvenient, so the price of the Exclusive Intimate Upgrade Certificate has been discounted to just $99. This means you only need to pay $99 for the full intimate upgrade certificate, which legally entitles you to a private intimate dinner  with the legendary Steve Perry, allowing you to connect with Steve Perry on a very deep and personal level.
