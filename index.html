<h5 class="text-amakapx6">

 Congratulations once again, Catherine! A few days ago, you registered and got approved for the Tom Jones Exclusive Meet and Greet in Minnesota, scheduled for October 26, 2025.


<br><br>

You will receive the Minnesota venue and time details via mail along with the ticket. The Meet and Greet offers two options, which are listed below:


<br><br>
1 - Group Meet and Greet
<br><br>
2 - Intimate Meet and Greet

<br><br><br>

Now, read the text below to understand the difference between the Group and Intimate options so you can make an informed decision at the end.




<br><br><br><br>



<strong>
1 - Group Meet and Greet:</strong>
<br>


The Group meet and greet gives you the chance to meet Tom Jones. However, there will be a few other fans present, making it a group experience.


<br><br><br><br>
<strong>
2 - Intimate Meet and Greet:
</strong>
<br>
The Intimate Meet and Greet is far superior, as it allows you to spend quality time alone with Tom Jones. This allows you to enjoy a private dinner with Tom Jones and even receive a hug from Tom Jones, ensuring all of 

Tom Jones's  attention will be on you.


 



<br><br><br>
<br>
<strong><center>Important Information</strong></center>

<br>


Catherine, 
make sure you have read and understood the text above explaining the differences between the Group and Intimate options.

<br><br>


This step below is the  most important step, as it determines whether you are placed in the Group meet and greet or if you upgrade to the Intimate.


 



<br><br><br>

The Group Meet and Greet is priced at just <strong><span class="currency-symbol">$</span>95</strong>, but if you wish to upgrade to the Intimate Meet and Greet, which includes a private dinner with Tom Jones and a chance to actually get a hug from the legendary Tom Jones, it is priced at <strong><span class="currency-symbol">$</span>189</strong>. 

<br><br>Catherine, 
choose your preferred option below: Group or Intimate?
