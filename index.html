Well done, Peg Culligan! You'll be pleased to learn that you've already completed the complex part of registering for the Tom Jones Meet and Greet last year; this event offers you a rare opportunity to have a private dinner with Tom Jones himself, where you'll even have the chance for a hug from the legendary Tom Jones.


<br><br>

Since you completed the meet and greet registration process last year, all you need to do now is get your ticket, as this ticket is required for authorized entry into the event venue in New Orleans in September.


<br><br><br>
You can easily purchase your ticket at a discounted price of just $99. Peg Culligan, while this $99 ticket purchase might seem significant depending on your financial situation, it will be well worth it, since this ticket ensures authorized access to the New Orleans event, where you'll enjoy a private dinner with Tom Jones and even have the chance for a hug from Tom Jones. This rare experience offers a chance to connect with Tom Jones on a deeply personal level, making the $99 ticket purchase price worth it. Additional event details, including the venue and time in New Orleans, will be included on your ticket.
